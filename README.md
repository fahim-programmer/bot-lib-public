# Bot_lib Public v1.0.0 Release 1-April 2023

This is python module aims to provide user-friendly interface to the web-automation and desktop automation tools available like Selenium. It offers driver management, proxies, proxy testing, shorter source code and faster development with cross browser script compatibility. The aim is to streamline the automation procedure, minimize the bot detection and minimize the time of development needed. The scripts generated with bot_lib could be very complex yet still very readable and less error-prone, and they are easier to maintain too.

## Usage

In VS Code make sure you have (venv) appearing at the end of the current terminal then put Bot_lib_Public.py into your directory and on the terminal run.

```
python Bot_lib_Public.py setup
```

It will install all the things needed to run this automatically so wait for a short moment. Alternatively, requirements.txt is also available.

Then use the module shown in the Usage.py. As it is the 1.0.0 release please feel free to report any bugs and feature recommendations or grammatical errors in this file. Thanks

#### About Private bot-lib version v1, v2, v3, v3dev and others:

The private version is buggy, sometimes unorganized and prone to changes in the future. The matured part of the private version is made public and employed in web scrapping projects, and many more.

#### Selenium, webdriver and its future:

As more and more websites are becoming advance, automation technology like selenium and web driver will be outdated very soon replaced with newer means to getting data off the web. Most widely used websites have immunity towards webdriver automation and can detect it without much effort. So, it is not wise to make very complex software directly using selenium in python. But, there are sites on which you can use bot-lib and selenium to quickly scrape data, so there is still use for this. The day this will stop working, you can count on me to put a message here that will show that this doesn't work.

### How I started with bot-lib?

I started to make bot lib which contained classes to automatically setup everything everytime I wanted to use selenium. I started making a very basic version in the end of 2021 in December then added new methods in the April of 2022, and then continued to improve it and add new things to the it. In August of 2022, I made it into a private repo on github and now I feel confident enough to release a public version of it, so you can spend less time when working it.
